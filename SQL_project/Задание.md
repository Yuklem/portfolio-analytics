## Main Task

Model changes in student balances. A balance is the number of lessons each student has. To check whether our data is consistent, generate a list of hypotheses and questions. It is important for us to understand:
+ How many total lessons were on the balance of **all students** for each calendar day;
+ How this number changed under the influence of transactions (payments, accruals, adjustment write-offs) and lessons (deductions from the balance as lessons are taken).

We also want to create a table showing the daily balances of **each student.**

### Expected Result
The result should be a query that collects data on student balances for each day they were active.

### Task 1
Look at the changes in student balances compiled from the CTE. Which data looks suspicious to you? What questions should be addressed to the data engineers and table owners?

### Task 2
Create a visualization (a line chart) of the final result. What conclusions can be drawn from the visualization?
