## Projects
Unit Economics Calculator for an Online Cinema: > <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3jp73s1J8QSszTQYZVOaz51V-X2HwfwxG-dq2270yE/edit?usp=sharing">Project Link</a>

<ol>To create this calculator, I collected all the raw financial indicators and, based on them, calculated new key units: LTR, CAC, LT. With their help, I managed to solve the given task, find Retention, and in comparison, show what was before and what it might look like not only in numbers but also in charts.</ol> 

<ol>Result: A functional calculator where forecasts for unit economics are displayed based on any given changes.</ol>

Modeling Student Balance Changes: > <a href="https://github.com/Yuklem/portfolio-analytics/tree/main/SQL_project">Project Link</a>

<ol>I wrote several CTE queries and used them to obtain an overall picture of all balances for a given year: transaction balances, remaining balances, purchased lesson balances, and their cumulative values. In the end, I visualized the data in Metabase and was able to track all changes dynamically.</ol>

<ol>Result: During the visualization stage, I noticed gaps between transactions and completed lessons, raised these issues with data engineers regarding anomalous negative or empty values.</ol>
